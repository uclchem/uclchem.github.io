To do this, MakeRates automatically duplicates all LH reactions so that a reaction on the surface and one in the bulk ice exists in the network. We then include two methods by which material can move between the bulk and the surface. First is the accumulation of the bulk as new surface layers are formed and second is the individual swapping of a particle from the bulk with one on the surface. Both of these processes are taken from Garrod & Pauly 2011","sidebar":"docs"},"chemical_analysis":{"id":"chemical_analysis","title":"Chemical Analysis","description":"Chemical networks are complex systems where the interplay between many elements often means that small changes in one aspect of the network can greatly effect the outcome in unexpected ways. Nevertheless, there are cases where a simple chemical explanation can be found for some observed behaviour in the model outputs. This tutorial demonstrates how to use some of the functionality of the UCLCHEM library to analyse model outputs and discover these explanations.","sidebar":"docs"},"desorb":{"id":"desorb","title":"Adsorption & Desorption Reactions","description":"Coupling between the gas and the grain chemistry primarily comes from the freeze out of material from the gas phase onto the dust grains (adsorption) and the sublimation of material from the grains into the gas phase (desorption). The major processes considered by UCLCHEM are listed below. Note that we assume desorption and freeze out occur between the gas and the surface only, bulk material in three phase models does not directly desorb into the gas phase.","sidebar":"docs"},"dev-debugging":{"id":"dev-debugging","title":"Debugging","description":"UCLCHEM is a complex code and many things can go wrong.

Writing the core of UCLCHEM in Fortran gives great performance benefits but compiling it to python with F2PY has its peculiarities. Here, we discuss the steps needed to adjust the code.","sidebar":"docs"},"dev-web":{"id":"dev-web","title":"Maintaining the Website","description":"We use Docusaurus to maintain our website.

This is unlikely to meet everybody\'s modelling needs and UCLCHEM is capable of modelling much more complex environments such as hot cores and shocks. In this tutorial, we model both a hot core and a shock to explore how these models work and to demonstrate the workflow that the UCLCHEM team normally follow.","sidebar":"docs"},"network":{"id":"network","title":"Creating a Network","description":"MakeRates","sidebar":"docs"},"parameters":{"id":"parameters","title":"Model Parameters","description":"UCLCHEM will default to these values unless they are overridden by user.
