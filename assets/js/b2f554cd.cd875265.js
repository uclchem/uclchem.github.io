Chemical reactions in the gas phase are one of the possible processes that could modify the  14 N/ 15 N ratio. We aim at investigating if and how the passage of a shock wave in the interstellar medium, can affect the relative fraction of nitrogen isotopes. The ideal place for such a study is the L1157 outflow, where several shocked clumps are present. We present the first measurement of the  14 N/ 15 N ratio in the two shocked clumps, B1 and B0, of the protostellar outflow L1157, derived from the interferomteric maps of the H 13 CN(1-0) and the HC 15 N(1-0) lines. In B1, we find that the H 13 CN(1-0) and HC 15 N(1-0) emission traces the front of the clump, with averaged column density of  N (H 13 CN)  \u223c  7 \xd7 10 12  cm \u22122  and  N (HC 15 N)  \u223c  2 \xd7 10 12  cm \u22122 . In this region the ratio H 13 CN(1-0)/HC 15 N(1-0) is quite uniform with an average value of  \u223c  5 \xb1 1. The same average value is also measured in the smaller clump B0e. Assuming the standard  12 C/ 13 C = 68, we obtain  14 N/ 15 N = 340 \xb1 70, similar to those usually found in prestellar cores and protostars. We analysed the prediction of a chemical shock model for several shock conditions and we found that the nitrogen and carbon fractionations do not vary much for the first period after the shock. The observed H 13 CN/HC 15 N can be reproduced by a non-dissociative, C-type shock with parameters in agreement with previous modelling of L1157-B1. Both observations and chemical models indicate that the shock propagation does not affect the nitrogen isotopic ratio that remains similar to that measured in lower temperature gas in prestellar cores and in protostellar envelopes."},{"id":"/2020/02/14/New-Website","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2020/02/14/New-Website","source":"@site/blog/2020-02-14-New-Website.md","title":"New Website","description":"We\'re replacing our old website!

Most molecular species show significantly more central depletion in subcritical models, due to the longer duration of collapse. However, the directly observable quantities - the molecule to hydrogen column density ratios - are generally too similar for observational data to discriminate between models. The profiles of N2H+ and HCO+ show qualitative differences between supercritical and subcritical models on scales of 0.01 pc, which may allow the two cases to be distinguished. However, this requires knowledge of the hydrogen column density, which is not directly measureable, and predicted line intensity profiles from radiative transfer modelling are similar for these molecules. Other commonly observed species, such as HCN and CH3OH, have line intensity profiles that differ more strongly between models, and so are more promising as tracers of the mechanism of cloud collapse."},{"id":"/2019/04/19/serena-nitrogen-frac","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2019/04/19/serena-nitrogen-frac","source":"@site/blog/2019-04-19-serena-nitrogen-frac.md","title":"Nitrogen fractionation in external galaxies","description":"UCLCHEM has recently been used to study nitrogen fractionation in external galaxies.

In this paper, we present a theoretical chemical study of nitrogen fractionation in external galaxies in order to determine the physical conditions that may lead to a spread of the 14N/15N ratio from the solar value of \u223c440 and hence evaluate the contribution of chemical reactions in the interstellar medium (ISM) to nitrogen fractionation.

We present a comprehensive study of the chemistry of three molecules containing peptide-like bonds: HNCO, NH2CHO, and CH3NCO. We also included other CHNO isomers (HCNO, HOCN) and C2H3NO isomers (CH3OCN, CH3CNO) to the study. We have used the UCLCHEM gas-grain chemical code and included in our chemical network all possible formation/destruction pathways of these peptide-like molecules recently investigated either by theoretical calculations or in laboratory experiments. Our predictions are compared to observations obtained towards the proto-star IRAS 16293-2422 and the L1544 pre-stellar core. Our results show that some key reactions involving the CHNO and C2H3NO isomers need to be modified to match the observations. Consistently with recent laboratory findings, hydrogenation is unlikely to produce NH2CHO on grain surfaces, while a combination of radical-radical surface reactions and gas-phase reactions is a better alternative. In addition, better results are obtained for NH2CHO when a slightly higher activation energy of 25 K is considered for the gas-phase reaction NH2 + H2CO \u2192 NH2CHO + H. Finally, our modelling shows that the observed correlation between NH2CHO and HNCO in star-forming regions may come from the fact that HNCO and NH2CHO react to temperature in the same manner rather than from a direct chemical link between the two species."},{"id":"/2018/06/20/izaskun-phosphorus","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2018/06/20/izaskun-phosphorus","source":"@site/blog/2018-06-20-izaskun-phosphorus.md","title":"The Chemistry of Phosphorus-bearing Molecules under Energetic Phenomena","description":"Izaskun Jimenez-Serra has published a study of the chemistry of phosophorus bearing species using UCLCHEM.

However, recent higher-sensitivity observations have revealed that molecules such as PN and PO are present not only toward cold massive cores and low-mass star-forming regions with PO/PN ratios \u22651 but also toward the giant molecular clouds in the Galactic center known to be exposed to highly energetic phenomena such as intense UV radiation fields, shock waves, and cosmic rays. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive study of the chemistry of phosphorus-bearing molecules across different astrophysical environments that cover a range of physical conditions (cold molecular dark clouds, warm clouds, and hot cores/hot corinos) and are exposed to different physical processes and energetic phenomena (proto-stellar heating, shock waves, intense UV radiation, and cosmic rays). We show how the measured PO/PN ratio (either \u22651, as in, e.g., hot molecular cores, or \u22641, as in UV strongly illuminated environments) can provide constraints on the physical conditions and energetic processing of the source. We propose that the reaction P + OH \u2192 PO + H, not included in previous works, could be an efficient gas-phase PO formation route in shocks. Our modeling provides a template with which to study the detectability of P-bearing species not only in regions in our own Galaxy but also in extragalactic sources."},{"id":"/2018/03/27/audrey-coms","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2018/03/27/audrey-coms","source":"@site/blog/2018-03-27-audrey-coms.md","title":"Chemical modelling of glycolaldehyde and ethylene glycol in star-forming regions","description":"Audrey Coutens has published modelling work on glycoaldehyde and ethylene glycol using UCLCHEM.

Recently, several molecules containing peptide-like bonds have been detected across multiple environments in the interstellar medium, growing the need to fully understand their chemistry and their role in forming larger pre-biotic molecules. We present a comprehensive study of the chemistry of three molecules containing peptide-like bonds: HNCO, NH2CHO, and CH3NCO. We also included other CHNO isomers (HCNO, HOCN) and C2H3NO isomers (CH3OCN, CH3CNO) to the study. We have used the UCLCHEM gas-grain chemical code and included in our chemical network all possible formation/destruction pathways of these peptide-like molecules recently investigated either by theoretical calculations or in laboratory experiments.
