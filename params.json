  "body": "UCLCHEM is a gas-grain chemical code written in Fortran 95. It propagates the abundances of chemical species through a network of user-defined reactions according to the physical conditions of the gas. Included in the repository is MakeRates, a python script to combine a species list, UMIST reaction file and user-define reaction file into a consistent network with all files required by UCLCHEM.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWeâ€™ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe fortran 95 version of UCLCHEM was created by @jonholdship based on Serena Viti's original code (Viti et al. 2004). MakeRates was created by @AntoniosMak.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIncluded in the repository is a PDF manual. Any further questions can be directed to jrh at star.ucl.ac.uk\r\n",
