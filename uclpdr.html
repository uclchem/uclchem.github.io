       <p>UCL_PDR is a one dimensional PDR code written in Fortran. It treats UV and X-ray radiation, with the radiation field either one- or two-sided. UCL_PDR can treat arbitrary, user-defined chemical networks, and provided collisional excitation data is available can compute line emission from any included molecular or atomic/ionic species. It can optionally calculate photorates from the wavelength-dependent cross-sections, if these are provided. The GitHub package comes with a selection of model clouds, radiation fields, chemical networks (including and excluding X-ray reactions), molecular cross-sections and collisional rate data for the main coolants in PDRs.</p>

      <p>UCL_PDR uses the Sundials package to solve the chemical network ODEs, and is parallelised with OpenMP. This version is a substantially upgraded version of the original UCL_PDR (Bell et al. 2005, 2006, Bayet et al. 2011), written by Tom Bell and described in Priestley et al. (2017, in press). It currently compiles with ifort.</p>
