Sign up to our mailing list [here](https://forms.gle/Mx6bEziSHFHUudyR9) and\nget some free UCLCHEM stickers!\n:::\n\nIt has been exactly 3 years since the last blog post on UCLCHEM; A lot has happened in UCLCHEM,\nin the meantime. In short: UCLCHEM has become 99% Python-first, with the legacy fortran interface\nnow fully deprecated. We added support for the new UMIST22 and KIDA24 databases. Makerates was greatly\nimproved to include more checks, and allow the user to more easily build their networks.  Additionally,\nwe greatly improved the ability to inspect reaction rates, allowing the user to understand which\nreactions are contributing the most. Lastly, we had to move to Meson as a build system, \nallowing us to continue supporting Python 3.12 and beyond.\n\nI want to highlight a few interesting articles that have used UCLCHEM over the past years,\nshowing that our astrochemical modeling (among other astrochemical codes) \nis essential to interpreting cutting edge ALMA, JWST and other observations.\n- [Modelling methanol and hydride formation in the JWST Ice Age era](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202452389)\n- [Neural Network Constraints on the Cosmic-Ray Ionization Rate and Other Physical\nConditions in NGC 253 with ALCHEMI Measurements of HCN and HNC](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ad85db)\n- [First detection of the pre-biotic molecule glycolonitrile (HOCH2CN) in the interstellar medium](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnrasl%2Fslz002)\n- [CHEMOUT: CHEMical complexity in star-forming regions of the OUTer Galaxy](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202451500)\n\nIn addition to these papers, there are currently a handful of papers in final stages of preparation\nand submission; They illustrate new modeling efforts by our group, connecting modeling and observations, \nas well as improving the chemical processes included, feedback from physical processes and\nnew types of objects we model.\n\nEntering the penultimate year of my PhD, there are still a lot of improvements that will be introduced,\nthat will cumulate to a UCLCHEM 4.0 paper. This paper will outline the entire UCLCHEM simulation framework,\nproviding insight to each of the mechanisms as they are currently implemented. Additions will include:\n- Many checks that help the user to make good modeling assumptions\n- Heating and cooling for consistently modeling gas at low and medium densities\n- Many technical improvements, some highlights are:\n  - A consolidated programming interface\n  - Python only (first) approach, allowing for seamless integration into pipelines, statistical samplers etc\n  - Interaction with and visualisation of the underlying reaction networks \n  - Easy inspection of underlying reaction rate (constants) to see which reactions matter most\n  - Better insight into what the solver (DVODE) is doing\n  - An improved storage format\nSo stay tuned for this. \n\nAs of today we release v3.5.1, this will be the final planned release before v4.0.0. \n\nTo highlight everything that was introduced over the past 3 years, you can find a brief AI\nsummary of the releases:\n\n\n## Releases:\n\n### v3.5.1 (July 2025) -

We model ALMA observations of emission from these molecules using UCLCHEM and [SpectralRadex](https://spectralradex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to infer the CRIR.

We then use our HITs to determine which observables are the most informative about various physical parameters. We do this by producing a large dataset of synthetic observations using UCLCHEM and RADEX to produce line intensities for every transition of every HIT under a wide range of physical conditions. We then calculate the [mutual information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information) between each molecular transition and each physical parameter and use these to rank the transitions. The information scores are all available on the [HITs website](https://hits.strw.leidenuniv.nl) which can be used to plan observations.\n\nBy choosing transitions of a HIT that have a high mutual information with your physical parameter of interest, you can obtain the best possible constraint on that parameter.

You can find [the paper here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14882.pdf) and the abstract below.\n\nThe isotopic ratio of nitrogen presents a wide range of values in the Solar System and in star forming system whose origin is still unclear. Chemical reactions in the gas phase are one of the possible processes that could modify the  14 N/ 15 N ratio. We aim at investigating if and how the passage of a shock wave in the interstellar medium, can affect the relative fraction of nitrogen isotopes. The ideal place for such a study is the L1157 outflow, where several shocked clumps are present. We present the first measurement of the  14 N/ 15 N ratio in the two shocked clumps, B1 and B0, of the protostellar outflow L1157, derived from the interferomteric maps of the H 13 CN(1-0) and the HC 15 N(1-0) lines. In B1, we find that the H 13 CN(1-0) and HC 15 N(1-0) emission traces the front of the clump, with averaged column density of  N (H 13 CN)  ∼  7 × 10 12  cm −2  and  N (HC 15 N)  ∼  2 × 10 12  cm −2 . In this region the ratio H 13 CN(1-0)/HC 15 N(1-0) is quite uniform with an average value of  ∼  5 ± 1. The same average value is also measured in the smaller clump B0e. Assuming the standard  12 C/ 13 C = 68, we obtain  14 N/ 15 N = 340 ± 70, similar to those usually found in prestellar cores and protostars. We analysed the prediction of a chemical shock model for several shock conditions and we found that the nitrogen and carbon fractionations do not vary much for the first period after the shock. The observed H 13 CN/HC 15 N can be reproduced by a non-dissociative, C-type shock with parameters in agreement with previous modelling of L1157-B1. Both observations and chemical models indicate that the shock propagation does not affect the nitrogen isotopic ratio that remains similar to that measured in lower temperature gas in prestellar cores and in protostellar envelopes."},{"id":"/2020/02/14/New-Website","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2020/02/14/New-Website","source":"@site/blog/2020-02-14-New-Website.md","title":"New Website","description":"We're replacing our old website!

However, chemical fractionation can potentially significantly alter this ratio and in fact observations of carbon fractionation within the same galaxy has been found to vary from species to species. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the carbon fractionation for selected abundant carbon-bearing species in order to determine the conditions that may lead to a spread of the 12C/13C ratio in external galaxies. We find that carbon fractionation is sensitive to almost all the physical conditions we investigated, it strongly varies with time for all species but CO, and shows pronounced differences across species. Finally, we discuss our theoretical results in the context of the few observations of the 12C/13C in both local and higher redshift galaxies."},{"id":"/2019/07/08/felix-ambipolar","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2019/07/08/felix-ambipolar","source":"@site/blog/2019-07-08-felix-ambipolar.md","title":"Ambipolar diffusion and the molecular abundances inprestellar cores","description":"Felix Priestley has used UCLCHEM in an investigation of the chemical differences caused by the magnetic fields in prestellar cores.

Most molecular species show significantly more central depletion in subcritical models, due to the longer duration of collapse. However, the directly observable quantities - the molecule to hydrogen column density ratios - are generally too similar for observational data to discriminate between models. The profiles of N2H+ and HCO+ show qualitative differences between supercritical and subcritical models on scales of 0.01 pc, which may allow the two cases to be distinguished. However, this requires knowledge of the hydrogen column density, which is not directly measureable, and predicted line intensity profiles from radiative transfer modelling are similar for these molecules. Other commonly observed species, such as HCN and CH3OH, have line intensity profiles that differ more strongly between models, and so are more promising as tracers of the mechanism of cloud collapse."},{"id":"/2019/04/19/serena-nitrogen-frac","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2019/04/19/serena-nitrogen-frac","source":"@site/blog/2019-04-19-serena-nitrogen-frac.md","title":"Nitrogen fractionation in external galaxies","description":"UCLCHEM has recently been used to study nitrogen fractionation in external galaxies.

The extent of the contribution of isotopic fractionation to these variations is, to date, unknown. In this paper, we present a theoretical chemical study of nitrogen fractionation in external galaxies in order to determine the physical conditions that may lead to a spread of the 14N/15N ratio from the solar value of ∼440 and hence evaluate the contribution of chemical reactions in the interstellar medium (ISM) to nitrogen fractionation. We find that the main cause of ISM enrichment of nitrogen fractionation is high gas densities, aided by high fluxes of cosmic rays."},{"id":"/2018/07/12/felix-collapse","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2018/07/12/felix-collapse","source":"@site/blog/2018-07-12-felix-collapse.md","title":"Collapsing Prestellar Cores - a new physics module","description":"Felix Priestley has used UCLCHEM to study the collapse of prestellar cores.

Recently, several molecules containing peptide-like bonds have been detected across multiple environments in the interstellar medium, growing the need to fully understand their chemistry and their role in forming larger pre-biotic molecules. We present a comprehensive study of the chemistry of three molecules containing peptide-like bonds: HNCO, NH2CHO, and CH3NCO. We also included other CHNO isomers (HCNO, HOCN) and C2H3NO isomers (CH3OCN, CH3CNO) to the study. We have used the UCLCHEM gas-grain chemical code and included in our chemical network all possible formation/destruction pathways of these peptide-like molecules recently investigated either by theoretical calculations or in laboratory experiments. Our predictions are compared to observations obtained towards the proto-star IRAS 16293-2422 and the L1544 pre-stellar core. Our results show that some key reactions involving the CHNO and C2H3NO isomers need to be modified to match the observations. Consistently with recent laboratory findings, hydrogenation is unlikely to produce NH2CHO on grain surfaces, while a combination of radical-radical surface reactions and gas-phase reactions is a better alternative. In addition, better results are obtained for NH2CHO when a slightly higher activation energy of 25 K is considered for the gas-phase reaction NH2 + H2CO → NH2CHO + H. Finally, our modelling shows that the observed correlation between NH2CHO and HNCO in star-forming regions may come from the fact that HNCO and NH2CHO react to temperature in the same manner rather than from a direct chemical link between the two species."},{"id":"/2018/06/20/izaskun-phosphorus","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2018/06/20/izaskun-phosphorus","source":"@site/blog/2018-06-20-izaskun-phosphorus.md","title":"The Chemistry of Phosphorus-bearing Molecules under Energetic Phenomena","description":"Izaskun Jimenez-Serra has published a study of the chemistry of phosophorus bearing species using UCLCHEM.

The [paper can be found here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07281.pdf) and the abstract is below.\n\nFor decades, the detection of phosphorus-bearing molecules in the interstellar medium was restricted to high-mass star-forming regions (e.g., SgrB2 and Orion KL) and the circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars. However, recent higher-sensitivity observations have revealed that molecules such as PN and PO are present not only toward cold massive cores and low-mass star-forming regions with PO/PN ratios ≥1 but also toward the giant molecular clouds in the Galactic center known to be exposed to highly energetic phenomena such as intense UV radiation fields, shock waves, and cosmic rays. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive study of the chemistry of phosphorus-bearing molecules across different astrophysical environments that cover a range of physical conditions (cold molecular dark clouds, warm clouds, and hot cores/hot corinos) and are exposed to different physical processes and energetic phenomena (proto-stellar heating, shock waves, intense UV radiation, and cosmic rays). We show how the measured PO/PN ratio (either ≥1, as in, e.g., hot molecular cores, or ≤1, as in UV strongly illuminated environments) can provide constraints on the physical conditions and energetic processing of the source. We propose that the reaction P + OH → PO + H, not included in previous works, could be an efficient gas-phase PO formation route in shocks. Our modeling provides a template with which to study the detectability of P-bearing species not only in regions in our own Galaxy but also in extragalactic sources."},{"id":"/2018/03/27/audrey-coms","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2018/03/27/audrey-coms","source":"@site/blog/2018-03-27-audrey-coms.md","title":"Chemical modelling of glycolaldehyde and ethylene glycol in star-forming regions","description":"Audrey Coutens has published modelling work on glycoaldehyde and ethylene glycol using UCLCHEM.
