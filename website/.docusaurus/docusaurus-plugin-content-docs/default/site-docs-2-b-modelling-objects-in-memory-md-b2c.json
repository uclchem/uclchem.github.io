  "description": "In the previous tutorial, we simply modelled the chemistry of a static cloud for 1 Myr. This is unlikely to meet everybody's modelling needs and UCLCHEM is capable of modelling much more complex environments such as hot cores and shocks. In this tutorial, we model both a hot core and a shock to explore how these models work and to demonstrate the workflow that the UCLCHEM team normally follow.",
