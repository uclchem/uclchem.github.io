It has been exactly 3 years since the last blog post on UCLCHEM; A lot has happened in UCLCHEM,
in the meantime. In short: UCLCHEM has become 99% Python-first, with the legacy fortran interface
now fully deprecated. We added support for the new UMIST22 and KIDA24 databases. Makerates was greatly
improved to include more checks, and allow the user to more easily build their networks.  Additionally,
we greatly improved the ability to inspect reaction rates, allowing the user to understand which
reactions are contributing the most. Lastly, we had to move to Meson as a build system, 
allowing us to continue supporting Python 3.12 and beyond.

I want to highlight a few interesting articles that have used UCLCHEM over the past years,
showing that our astrochemical modeling (among other astrochemical codes) 
is essential to interpreting cutting edge ALMA, JWST and other observations.
- [Modelling methanol and hydride formation in the JWST Ice Age era](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202452389)
- [Neural Network Constraints on the Cosmic-Ray Ionization Rate and Other Physical
Conditions in NGC 253 with ALCHEMI Measurements of HCN and HNC](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ad85db)
- [First detection of the pre-biotic molecule glycolonitrile (HOCH2CN) in the interstellar medium](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnrasl%2Fslz002)
- [CHEMOUT: CHEMical complexity in star-forming regions of the OUTer Galaxy](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202451500)

In addition to these papers, there are currently a handful of papers in final stages of preparation
and submission; They illustrate new modeling efforts by our group, connecting modeling and observations, 
as well as improving the chemical processes included, feedback from physical processes and
new types of objects we model.

Entering the penultimate year of my PhD, there are still a lot of improvements that will be introduced,
that will cumulate to a UCLCHEM 4.0 paper. This paper will outline the entire UCLCHEM simulation framework,
providing insight to each of the mechanisms as they are currently implemented. Additions will include:
- Many checks that help the user to make good modeling assumptions
- Heating and cooling for consistently modeling gas at low and medium densities
- Many technical improvements, some highlights are:
  - A consolidated programming interface
  - Python only (first) approach, allowing for seamless integration into pipelines, statistical samplers etc
  - Interaction with and visualisation of the underlying reaction networks 
  - Easy inspection of underlying reaction rate (constants) to see which reactions matter most
  - Better insight into what the solver (DVODE) is doing
  - An improved storage format
So stay tuned for this. 

As of today we release v3.5.1, this will be the final planned release before v4.0.0. 

To highlight everything that was introduced over the past 3 years, you can find a brief AI
