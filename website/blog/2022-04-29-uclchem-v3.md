UCLCHEM has had a major update! The new version is v3.0 and has many changes. Here are some of the key updates:

- UCLCHEM is now entirely python-centric and pip installable.
- MakeRates is smarter than ever and does much more of the work of building a network for you.
- Three phase chemistry is now the default and well bug tested.
- You no longer have to recompile the code to change physics modules.

Check out our docs pages for all the updates and tutorials on how to use the new version.
