@article{Viti1999,
abstract = {Hot cores are rich in saturated molecules that are believed to arise from the evaporation of molecular ices on dust grains. It is usually assumed that the ices are evaporated instantaneously when a nearby star is switched on. We have developed a new model in which the grain temperature rises over a time-scale determined by the switch-on time of the star. This time-scale is likely to be comparable to the lifetime of the hot cores. In consequence, evaporation of different species occurs at different epochs, leading to chemical differentiation in time and space within the hot core. By computing qualitative models of hot cores, we show that observations of hot cores may be able to constrain the rise time of hot stars to the main sequence.},

@article{Holdship2015,
abstract = {A gas-grain time dependent chemical code, UCL$\backslash${\_}CHEM, has been used to investigate the possibility of using chemical tracers to differentiate between the possible formation mechanisms of brown dwarfs. In this work, we model the formation of a pre-brown dwarf core through turbulent fragmentation by following the depth-dependent chemistry in a molecular cloud through the step change in density associated with an isothermal shock and the subsequent freefall collapse once a bound core is produced. Trends in the fractional abundance of molecules commonly observed in star forming cores are then explored to find a diagnostic for identifying brown dwarf mass cores formed through turbulence. We find that the cores produced by our models would be bright in CO and NH{\$}{\_}3{\$} but not in HCO{\$}{\^{}}+{\$}. This differentiates them from models using purely freefall collapse as such models produce cores that would have detectable transitions from all three molecules.},

@article{Holdship2016,
abstract = {Sulfur-bearing molecules are highly reactive in the gas phase of the ISM. However, the form in which most of the sulfur is locked onto interstellar dust grains is unknown. By taking advantage of the short time-scales of shocks in young molecular outflows, one could track back the main form of sulfur in the ices. In this paper, six transitions of H{\$}{\_}2{\$}S and its isotopologues in the L1157-B1 bowshock have been detected using data from the Herschel-CHESS survey and the IRAM-30m ASAI large program. These detections are used to calculate the properties of H{\$}{\_}2{\$}S gas in L1157-B1 through use of a rotation diagram and to explore the possible carriers of sulfur on the grains. The isotopologue detections allow the first calculation of the H{\$}{\_}2{\$}S deuteration fraction in an outflow from a low mass protostar. The fractional abundance of H{\$}{\_}2{\$}S in the region is found to be 6.0{\$}\backslashtimes{\$}10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-7{\}}{\$} and the deuteration fraction is 2{\$}\backslashtimes{\$}10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$}. In order to investigate the form of sulfur on the grains, a chemical model is run with four different networks, each with different branching ratios for the freeze out of sulfur bearing species into molecules such as OCS and H{\$}{\_}2{\$}S. It is found that the model best fits the data when at least half of each sulfur bearing species hydrogenates when freezing. We therefore conclude that a significant fraction of sulfur in L1157-B1 is likely to be locked in H{\$}{\_}2{\$}S on the grains.},
