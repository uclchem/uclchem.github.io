# Writing Style Samples 🖋️

**Purpose:** Capture a few short, representative sentences in your own voice so I can infer tone, vocabulary, and phrasing preferences and then apply them across the site.

## How this works 💡
- You provide short samples for each prompt below.
- I will analyze them for tone, sentence length, technicality, and preferred phrasing.
- I will return a concise style summary and example rewrites that match your voice.

## What to provide (short examples — 1–3 sentences each)
1. **Blog post intro** (audience: broader users/researchers) — example:

   Example: "UCLCHEM 3.5 simplifies setting up cloud and shock models with a new object-oriented API, while increasing performance for large grids. In this post we show how to get started and migrate existing scripts in minutes."

2. **Installation snippet** (audience: users installing the package) — example:

   Example: "Clone the repository and install the package in your environment:
   ```bash
git clone https://github.com/uclchem/UCLCHEM.git
cd UCLCHEM
pip install .
```
   If you use macOS with Apple Silicon, we recommend creating a conda env and installing `gfortran` from `conda-forge` first."

3. **Quickstart lead-in** (audience: users following a tutorial) — example:

   Example: "In the next three steps you'll create a simple cloud model, run it, and plot the resulting abundances — no prior Fortran experience required."

4. **Release announcement (short)** — example:

   Example: "UCLCHEM 3.5 released: faster grids, clearer API, and improved notebook tutorials — try it now."

5. **Tone & person preferences** — describe 2–3 adjectives (e.g., *concise, friendly, authoritative*) and which grammatical voice you prefer (e.g., *use 'you'*, *use 'we'*).

## Optional: add one sentence about your target audience for the site
(e.g., "primary audience: computational astrochemists and graduate students").
